Oh oh oh

Your love has brought me here, Jesus.
Your grace has saved me, dear Jesus.
Your life, You gave and sacrificed

No longer I, No longer I
Jesus' living in me
No longer I, No longer I
Christ's alive in Me

And if our God is here with us,
Then who could ever stand against us?
In all of these things, we are more than conquerors.

I am no longer under my past. 
I am no longer under the dark. 
I am no longer under my flesh. 
'cause Jesus is living in me. 

And on that day, you were nailed.
And in all of my debt, you paid, and you said
It is all finished.
